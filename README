This is a Linux kernel module for raspberry pi3 which functions as a
'codecless i2s soundcard'.  In other words, load either the master or
slave .ko with insmod, then bare i2s will be input/output to/from the
pins of the raspberry pi.  You need to ensure samplerates, bit-depths
etc line up, whereas with most alsa userspace drivers this is not an
issue...

Tested on raspberry pi3 with arch linux & a custom-compiled RT
kernel.

Pin 12 = i2s bitclock (bck)
Pin 35 = i2s word clock (wck)
Pin 38 = i2s data in to the pi (data_in)
Pin 40 = i2s data out from the pi (data_out)

You can check it's working by insmod-ing the 'master' kernel module,
then hooking up ch1 of scope to wck, then set ch1 as the trigger
source.  Probing bck, you probably see 32 x the frequency square wave.
Probing data_out you should see all 0 until you output some digital
data, then with output you should see the individual bits of the data
words flipping on & off...
